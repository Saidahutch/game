        <h1>My definition of a game</h1>
       <p>
        A game is someting people play for fun that may of may not have rules.
        </p> 
        <h2>My Gamer Type</h2>
        <p>
         After taking the Bartle test I got my results back for which type of gamer I am. Before taking the test I thought I was an Explorer but, after the test I learned
          I am actually 63% killer. 
        </p>
        <h2> My favorite Game</h2>
        <p>
         If I had to choose a favorite game I would choose Uno because it's simple but, it can get very competitive depending on who you play with.
