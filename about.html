        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ About The Creators</h1>
        <h2>Saida</h2>
            <li>My name is Saida Hutchinson</li>
        <p> For this project I am the Lead Web Designer and Social Impact Engineer. This means that I will be creating most
            of the website for our project. I am also the Social Impact Engieer so, I add that to the game. In this case it's 
            global warming and climate change that effects animals homes. 
        </p>
        <h2>Matthew</h2>
        <li>My name is Matthew Panton</li>
        <p>
            For this project I am the Head Python Programer and Head of Marketing and Business. This means
            that I will make the coding aspect of our board game which is the opening and closing of the doors. I will also be in charge of the marketing and 
            business part of this project so, that means the box the gameis held in.
        </p>
        <h2>Justin</h2>
        <li>My name is Justin Trinidad</li>
       <p> 
           For this project I am the Lead 3D Artist and Gameplay Designer. I've created all of the 3D models used for this game except for the bear and the bunny.  The biggest 3d model I made for this project was designing the entire board game.
           My secondary role is the Gameplay designer. I had the idea of the board game and figured out how the game is supposed to work. With the help of my teammates, we made the
           rulebook for this game.
        </ul>
        <h1>Our definition of a game</h1>
       <p>
        A game is someting people play for fun that needs skill and chance and it may of may not have rules.
        </p> 
        <h1>Our Gamer Type</h1>
    <p>
        In class we took a test called The Bartle Test which tests the type of gamer you are by a few multiple choice questions
    </p> 
        <li>Saida- for my gamer type, I assumed I would be an explorer but, after the test, I saw I was a killer.</li>
        <li>Matthew- as for my gamer type, I already assumed I would be a killer because of the types of games I play and I was right.</li>
        <li>Justin-for my gamer type I also thought I would be a killer because I am pretty competitive and I was correct.</li>
