	In this model you can see how negatively animal translocation effects not just the animals, but us too! Our game is about animals racing to the end of a game, it's
	background meaning is to show how animals moving affects them negatively. As seen in the game, bad things happen to the animals the farther in the game they move, just like
	in real life. So, this is to spread awarness on how bad this is for the animals and us. 
	</p>
	<h2)How will we know it worked?</h2>
	<p>
		To see if our game spread some awarness, we will be looking at the game players to see if you display some signs that they are upset that the animals/their 
		game player is getting hurt or damaged all the time.  </p>
	<h2>The signs that it worked</h2>
	<li>The players get upset that they are always getting hurt</li>
	<li>The players seem aggravated that the game is geting harder</li>
	<li>The players start telling us that the game is too hard</li>
	<h2>How we will collect this data</h2>
	<p> 
		To collect this data we will be taking notes on these behaviors to prove if our game worked or not. This feedback helps us make future 
		improvements on the game so it even better and have a bigger impact. 
		</p>
